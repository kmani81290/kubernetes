k8s - 
container orchestation - orchestrate containers different running containers

k86 architecture 

Node - application running space that could phsical or virtual worker node
cluster - set of nodes  if node fail sharing between us
master - manage monitor to move fail and move works, node with master will be there

components- 
  API Server --> front end of k86 , user managment, cmd line interface
  etcd --> distributer, reliable key value store used by k86  store all data used to manage the cluster 
  Kublet --> agent to run each node in cluster, its responsible for making sure  that the containers are running on the node has expected
  Container Run Time  -- software using containers like docker, but different cases are there
  Contrller - make decission of create new containers,   brain behind, 
  Scheduler --> distributing the works accross multiple nodes,
